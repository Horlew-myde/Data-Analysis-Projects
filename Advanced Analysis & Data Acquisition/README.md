# Data Analysis & Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a data professional passionate about uncovering insights from data and building impactful solutions. This repository showcases a collection of projects I've completed, demonstrating my skills in data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interpretation. My goal is to leverage these skills to help organizations make data-driven decisions.

This collection focuses on **Tier 3: Advanced Analysis & Data Acquisition**, where I tackle less-structured data, work with APIs, perform geospatial and time-series analysis, and acquire data through web scraping.
